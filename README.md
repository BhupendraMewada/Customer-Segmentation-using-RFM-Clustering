## Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

### Overview

This project focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using K-Means clustering. By applying Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, this project aims to identify and understand different customer segments to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer relationship management.

### Project Details

1. **Data Preparation**
   - The dataset includes customer transaction records with attributes related to transaction dates and amounts.
   - RFM analysis is performed to derive metrics for Recency (time since last purchase), Frequency (number of transactions), and Monetary (total spend).

2. **Clustering Approach**
   - **K-Means Algorithm**: Utilized to group customers into clusters based on RFM metrics.
   - **Elbow Method**: Applied to determine the optimal number of clusters.

3. **Analysis and Visualization**
   - Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of customers across different clusters.
   - Insights are drawn to identify key characteristics of each customer segment.

4. **Implementation**
   - **Tools Used**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

### Results

The project identifies several distinct customer segments, providing valuable insights into customer behavior. This segmentation helps in personalizing marketing strategies, improving customer satisfaction, and driving targeted business actions.
